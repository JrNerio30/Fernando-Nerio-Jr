            During my spare time, I love exploring food places and trying new foods.
            I also workout to keep my self not only motivated but also to be fit.
            And whenever it's sunrise, sunset, or blue hours, I love to go outside and
            feel the vibe, take a loads of photos and then edit them into a nostalgic photo.

            Favorite Video Games
          </h2>
          <p class="about__text--paragraph">
            I've been playing video games since I was a kid, and my first game was 
            Defense of the Ancients (Dota) on PC. I was so addicted to it that I played pretty much every day. 
            I wasn't very good, but I had so much fun. Then Dota 2 came along, one of my favorite games of all time. 
            I've logged almost 5k hours on it, and yet I'm still only average. I'd say the second favorite video game 
            I've played was Red Dead Redemption 2, which is also one of the best story games I've experienced.

            Favorite TV-Show
          </h2>
          <p class="about__text--paragraph">
            One of my favorite tv-shows of all time is Avatar: The Last Airbender, hands down. It may be old,
            maybe not that old but it taught me so many lessons in life. The story is just amazing and the character
            that feel like I relate to more was Zuko. He had such a great character arc. My girlfriend put me on.

            Favorite Sports
          </h2>
          <p class="about__text--paragraph">
            I've played so many sports in my life. Pretty much every sports you can name of and I enjoyed all of them.
            But the one that I played the most is basketball, it's just every I play ball, I forget everything and all I'm thinking
            of is bounce the ball and shoot. Second is Road cycling.
